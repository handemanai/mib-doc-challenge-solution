# MIB Doc Challenge — Submission Record

- **Solution repository:** <https://github.com/handemanai/mib-doc-challenge-solution>
- **Candidate:** handemanai

This is an offline, CPU-only document-adjudication system. It recovers the nine
required fields from adversarial PDF packets, applies deterministic policy, and
emits `APPROVED`, `DENIED`, or `NEEDS_REVIEW` with calibrated confidence. It
contains no LLM, VLM, cloud OCR, network service, API key, or component that
follows document instructions.

The submitted file came from one end-to-end native-ARM64 container invocation
of the named source. No row was edited by hand. Under the official 4-vCPU,
8-GiB, read-only-root, no-network contract, the run processed all 5,000 PDFs in
**19,186.18 seconds**—**5 hours, 19 minutes, 46 seconds**, or **3.8372 seconds
per PDF**. It made **82 fresh-process retries**, all recovered: 81 followed
watchdog exits with no primary state and one followed a per-case timeout. There
were zero terminal failures, governor level 0 for every row, and no
batch-deadline backfill. The official validator accepted all 5,000 records, and
the full source/runtime/input/output binding and strict evidence census passed.

## Approach and safety boundaries

- **Visible evidence controls decisions.** Hidden spans are masked before image
  enhancement and OCR. The runtime does not parse hidden verdict direction;
  hidden values never populate fields or support approval or denial. Generic
  hidden-content metadata may only lower trust, narrow to review, or contribute
  to calibration.
- **Evidence remains source-bound.** Native text, masked renders, targeted pixel
  readers, and an authorized raw-scan view remain separate channels. A direct
  scan read must be bound to the page a viewer sees; otherwise that channel
  abstains or uses a fresh composited render.
- **Authority is fail-closed.** Signed-note and stamp findings require an
  accepted visible surface. Native-text authority also requires exact 250-DPI
  raster/OCR corroboration. Foreign-case pages are quarantined, conflicts remain
  explicit, and ambiguous cancellation cannot create an approval.
- **Policy precedes confidence.** Deterministic rules adjudicate the emitted
  fields first. An out-of-fold logistic/isotonic model then estimates confidence
  from evidence quality. Expected-value analysis is development-only and does
  not route production decisions.
- **Completion is conservative.** Per-case deadlines, a parent heartbeat,
  worker recycling after 48 durable cases, atomic checkpoints, bounded retries,
  a batch governor, and a finalization reserve prevent one pathological PDF from
  invalidating the batch. Anything unresolved becomes a valid `NEEDS_REVIEW`
  row.

Prediction code and model artifacts contain no validation-case answer table or
case-specific runtime lookup. The container accepts arbitrary mounted input and
output paths and ships no challenge labels or validation data.

## Reproduce and validate

Set `CHALLENGE_DIR` to an absolute checkout of the official challenge
repository, then run from this solution repository:

```bash
CHALLENGE_DIR=/absolute/path/to/mib-doc-challenge
OUTPUT_DIR=/tmp/mib-submission-output
PRODUCER_SHA=4313d28b34abc4cef4c89586060f4d3d34848c88
mkdir -p "$OUTPUT_DIR"
git checkout --detach "$PRODUCER_SHA"

docker build --platform linux/amd64 \
  --label "org.opencontainers.image.revision=$PRODUCER_SHA" \
  -t "mib-submission:$PRODUCER_SHA" .
docker run --rm --platform linux/amd64 \
  --network none --cpus 4 --memory 8g --pids-limit 512 \
  --read-only --security-opt no-new-privileges \
  --tmpfs /tmp:rw,nosuid,nodev,size=2g \
  --mount type=bind,src="$CHALLENGE_DIR/data/validation",dst=/input,readonly \
  --mount type=bind,src="$OUTPUT_DIR",dst=/output \
  "mib-submission:$PRODUCER_SHA" /input /output/predictions.jsonl

python3 "$CHALLENGE_DIR/scripts/validate_submission.py" \
  --submission "$OUTPUT_DIR/predictions.jsonl" \
  --manifest "$CHALLENGE_DIR/data/validation_manifest.csv" \
  --require-complete
```

The submitted prediction file lives in the challenge repository under
`submissions/handemanai/`; it is not duplicated here.

| Memory ≤ 8 GiB | 8-GiB hard limit enforced by Docker |
| Image ≤ 4 GiB uncompressed | 316,434,546-byte AMD64 image; 286,493,358-byte ARM64 image |
| Models ≤ 1 GiB total / 250 MiB each | 28,750,436 bytes total / 10,857,958 bytes largest |
| Output ≤ 25 MiB | 1,683,486 bytes |

The pinned release suite reported **1,183 passed, 106 controlled skips, and zero
failures** with the complete challenge checkout available. A 12-case adversarial
panel produced 12 valid rows with no missing cases or leaked poison tokens,
byte-identically across two native ARM64 runs and one emulated AMD64 run.

## Limitations and disclosure

The complete generation run was native ARM64. The AMD64 image was built and
tested under emulation on Apple silicon, not on native x86 hardware. On an
eight-case OCR-sensitive panel, adjudications matched across architectures, but
fields differed on all eight and two AMD64 cases exhausted timeout and retry
before emitting conservative fallbacks. No full-batch AMD64 throughput or
cross-platform row-identity claim is made.

I am a practicing surgeon, not a software engineer. I entered this challenge to
ask how far I could get by directing coding agents when I do not know how to
read or write code. I spent my time asking skeptical questions and pushing the
agents to review and re-review their work. Beyond that, I tried to stay out of
their way. The agents did all of the implementation, testing, analysis, and
drafting.

[`MEMO.md`](MEMO.md) gives the technical rationale and remaining failure
boundary. [`docs/REVIEWER_GUIDE.md`](docs/REVIEWER_GUIDE.md) maps claims to
public source and tests. [`NOTICE.md`](NOTICE.md) records dependency licenses,
model provenance, and the non-hash-locked rebuild boundary.
