# MIB Doc Challenge — Submission Record

- **Solution repository:** <https://github.com/handemanai/mib-doc-challenge-solution>
- **Candidate:** handemanai

This repository contains the offline, CPU-only system that produced the
submitted validation predictions. It combines OCR and computer vision with a
deterministic adjudication policy; it does not use an LLM, cloud service, or
network access at inference time.

## Final artifact

| Item | Final identity |
| --- | --- |
| Validation predictions | `5,000` records; `0` missing; `1,683,486` bytes |
| Predictions SHA-256 | `4ff616d449d1931b461220b21b9c9ca2d1dba3bb82b6e3c021bf659b8f2822be` |
| Prediction-producing source | `4313d28b34abc4cef4c89586060f4d3d34848c88` |
| ARM64 image used for generation | `sha256:21515e59b31fecaed2eb9983527c0751079abc9c9d3c7711142214c523bdae3f` (286,493,358 bytes) |
| AMD64 image tested under emulation | `sha256:f6447a9720c0ca52616d83f245ecb804d418b94bd503f8fe57fe551a3e36f95d` (316,434,546 bytes) |

The submitted file came from one end-to-end native-ARM64 container invocation
of the named source. No row was edited by hand. Under the official 4-vCPU,
8-GiB, read-only-root, no-network contract, the run processed all 5,000 PDFs in
**19,186.18 seconds**—**5 hours, 19 minutes, 46 seconds**, or **3.8372 seconds
per PDF**. It made **82 fresh-process retries**, all recovered: 81 followed
watchdog exits with no primary state and one followed a per-case timeout. There
were zero terminal failures, governor level 0 for every row, and no
batch-deadline backfill. The official validator accepted all 5,000 records, and
the full source/runtime/input/output binding and strict evidence census passed.

The container accepts arbitrary mounted input and output paths. It ships no
challenge labels, validation data, validation-case answer table, or
case-specific runtime lookup. The approach and its safety boundaries are
explained in [`MEMO.md`](MEMO.md); the claim-by-claim verification map is in
[`docs/REVIEWER_GUIDE.md`](docs/REVIEWER_GUIDE.md).

## Reproduce and validate

Set `CHALLENGE_DIR` to an absolute checkout of the official challenge
repository, then run from this solution repository:

```bash
CHALLENGE_DIR=/absolute/path/to/mib-doc-challenge
OUTPUT_DIR=/tmp/mib-submission-output
PRODUCER_SHA=4313d28b34abc4cef4c89586060f4d3d34848c88
mkdir -p "$OUTPUT_DIR"
git checkout --detach "$PRODUCER_SHA"

docker build --platform linux/amd64 \
  --label "org.opencontainers.image.revision=$PRODUCER_SHA" \
  -t "mib-submission:$PRODUCER_SHA" .
docker run --rm --platform linux/amd64 \
  --network none --cpus 4 --memory 8g --pids-limit 512 \
  --read-only --security-opt no-new-privileges \
  --tmpfs /tmp:rw,nosuid,nodev,size=2g \
  --mount type=bind,src="$CHALLENGE_DIR/data/validation",dst=/input,readonly \
  --mount type=bind,src="$OUTPUT_DIR",dst=/output \
  "mib-submission:$PRODUCER_SHA" /input /output/predictions.jsonl

python3 "$CHALLENGE_DIR/scripts/validate_submission.py" \
  --submission "$OUTPUT_DIR/predictions.jsonl" \
  --manifest "$CHALLENGE_DIR/data/validation_manifest.csv" \
  --require-complete
```

The submitted prediction file lives in the challenge repository under
`submissions/handemanai/`; it is not duplicated here.

## Contract measurements

| Official constraint | Measured result |
| --- | --- |
| Runtime ≤ 6 s/PDF average | `3.8372` s/PDF on native ARM64 |
| 5,000-PDF runtime ≤ 30,000 s | `19,186.18` s on native ARM64 |
| Memory ≤ 8 GiB | 8-GiB hard limit enforced by Docker |
| Image ≤ 4 GiB uncompressed | 316,434,546-byte AMD64 image; 286,493,358-byte ARM64 image |
| Models ≤ 1 GiB total / 250 MiB each | 28,750,436 bytes total / 10,857,958 bytes largest |
| Output ≤ 25 MiB | 1,683,486 bytes |

The pinned release suite reported **1,183 passed, 106 controlled skips, and zero
failures** with the complete challenge checkout available. A 12-case adversarial
panel produced 12 valid rows with no missing cases or leaked poison tokens,
byte-identically across two native ARM64 runs and one emulated AMD64 run.

## Limitations and disclosure

The complete generation run was native ARM64. The AMD64 image was built and
tested under emulation on Apple silicon, not on native x86 hardware. On an
eight-case OCR-sensitive panel, adjudications matched across architectures, but
fields differed on all eight and two AMD64 cases exhausted timeout and retry
before emitting conservative fallbacks. No full-batch AMD64 throughput or
cross-platform row-identity claim is made.

I am a practicing surgeon, not a software engineer. I cannot read or write
code. I entered the challenge to test whether curiosity and persistence were
enough to compete when AI wrote the code. I kept pushing, asked skeptical
questions, and demanded repeated review; the agents did all of the
implementation, testing, analysis, and drafting. [`MEMO.md`](MEMO.md) gives the
full author note and technical rationale. [`NOTICE.md`](NOTICE.md) records
dependency licenses, model provenance, and the non-hash-locked rebuild boundary.
