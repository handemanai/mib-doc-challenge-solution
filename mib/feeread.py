"""Narrow, asymmetric fee-status reader for damaged scanned receipts.

The shipped pixel decoder (``mib/pixmatch.py``) abstains on ``fee_status``: on
the eval half of dev the whole-string NCC decode measured 83% precision, below
the 95% ship bar, because "paid" aliases onto the tail of "unpaid" (substring
match) and washed-out receipts collapse the value margins. Those two failures
matter asymmetrically — a resurrected "unpaid" is a false denial and a
resurrected "paid" is a false approval — so this channel reads the fee line
with direction-specific evidence and refuses anything it cannot positively
support.

Design (validated on dev, 288 fee-unread cases):

* Receipt-page gate. Only pages the parser typed ``fee_receipt`` (pipeline-
  confirmed) or ``unknown`` with a strong pixmatch "Fee Status:" anchor
  (>= ``RECEIPT_LNCC``) are considered. This recovers damaged receipts the
  typer dropped to ``unknown`` (e.g. MIB-000192) without trusting phantom
  anchors that the same template throws on intake/registry pages.
* Cancellation-stamp guard. An office stamp (ARCHIVE / FILED / COPY /
  DUPLICATE / VOID / ...) marks a superseded copy whose printed value is not
  current — the parser already treats these pages as non-evidence, so the
  reader must too, or it re-introduces exactly the stale values the pipeline
  drops (e.g. MIB-000323 prints an unstruck "unpaid" under an ARCHIVE stamp
  while the true status is paid). "SAMPLE DENIAL" is a denial watermark, not a
  cancellation, and does not block the read.
* Prefix asymmetry. "unpaid" is accepted only when the "un" strokes are
  positively present (the "paid" template matches shifted right by the prefix
  width, with ink filling the [0, x) zone, and the whole-"unpaid" template
  corroborates). "paid" is accepted only when that prefix zone is positively
  clean (the "paid" template sits at the strip head with no ink to its left).
* Strike guard. A value cancelled by a colored vector strike is already in
  ``struck_values``; the reader drops it too, and ``decide`` re-filters the
  injected candidate for defense in depth.

Accepted reads are injected into the fee_status pool as
``[value, "fee_roi", 5, score, value]``; ``decide`` applies the usual
precedence and strike filtering.
