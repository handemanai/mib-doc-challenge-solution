"""Narrow, asymmetric recovery reader for damaged Manual Adjudicator Notes.

A legible note ``Finding:`` line is already the pipeline's strongest authority
(``parse_ocr`` reads it and ``decide`` treats it as rank-1, 252/252 on dev).
This channel targets only the notes whose composited OCR left the finding
UNREAD (``doc_notes["finding"] is None``) while the note-page pixels still carry
a recoverable verdict — either in the ``Finding:`` value strip (label garbled,
value survives: e.g. MIB-000444 prints "DENIED" under an "inaing" label; MIB-
000134/000589 need pixel NCC) or in the deterministic generator ``Reason:``
sentence (e.g. "Denial supported by damaged registry evidence..." -> DENIED,
"Packet contains damaged or contradictory visible evidence." -> NEEDS_REVIEW).

Deny and review directions ONLY. APPROVED is never emitted and never enabled:
the emission vocabulary is ``{DENIED, NEEDS_REVIEW}``. An APPROVED render is
kept in the finding-value ranking purely as a REJECTION discriminator (on a
truth-APPROVED note the "DENIED" template would otherwise win the strip by
default — MIB-000176 proves it), and an approval-side ``Reason:`` sentence is a
hard abstain signal for the whole packet.

Design:

* Two independent channels, each internally two-view:
  - Finding value. ``find_label("Finding:")`` anchors the value strip; the
    strip is read by template NCC over ``{DENIED, NEEDS_REVIEW, APPROVED}`` at
    TWO preprocessings (raw + contrast-stretched). A ``{DENIED, NEEDS_REVIEW}``
    read is accepted only when both views rank the same value first, at the
    strip head, above the NCC floor and margin, and APPROVED wins neither view.
  - Reason sentence. The note page is OCR'd fast + HQ; each ``Reason:`` line is
    matched against a bank of unanimous generator reason->finding templates
    (mined corpus-wide; the finding-AGNOSTIC "Embargo home world: Wolf-1061c."
    reason is deliberately excluded because it maps to both DENIED and
    NEEDS_REVIEW). Unknown-typed pages face the stricter boundary: page-local
    case binding, at least two independent note-structure signals, and a
    DENIED reason must agree across fast+HQ or be corroborated by the direct
    finding-value channel.
* Hard guards: the finding is unread and unconflicted; the note page carries no
  recognized or fuzzy SAMPLE-DENIAL watermark; the packet names no foreign case
  id; unknown pages bind the active id locally and carry no cancellation stamp;
  no note page reads a different finding; and the value is not struck.
* Direction asymmetry is enforced by ``decide`` (see pipeline): a recovered
  DENIED may only flip NEEDS_REVIEW -> DENIED; a recovered NEEDS_REVIEW may only
  flip a terminal decision -> NEEDS_REVIEW. This module only ever RETURNS a
  finding; it never widens toward approval.
